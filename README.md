# Syte2

Syte2 is the new and refined version of [Syte](http://github.com/rigoneri/syte), a personal website with interactive social integrations. Syte2 integrates with Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Github, Dribbble, Spotify/Last.fm, YouTube and Tumblr. You can see it in action on [my personal site](http://rigoneri.com).

## Stream/Timeline

Syte2 starts of with your social stream. It groups all integrations into a nice and easy to follow timeline.

## Technologies Used

Syte2 is MEAN! It uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

For development Syte2 uses [LESS](http://lesscss.org) as the CSS pre-processor.

Syte2 also uses a font for [icons](client/app/fonts). I should probably document how I design and build those fonts.

For deployment Syte2 uses [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) (since they have a free option) with [mLab MongoDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab) add-on.

## Deployment Instructions

For now I've only deployed my website to Heroku since it's free to start out. I would love to see it deployed to different services.

* [Heroku deployment instructions](docs/heroku.md)
* [Docker deployment instructions](docks/docker.md)
* AWS deployment instructions (TODO)
* Google Cloud deployment instructions (TODO)

## Contributing

There are plans for several services to be added in the [TODO file](docs/TODO.md). One of these services is a good place to start when looking for ways to help. Also posting/fixing [issues](https://github.com/rigoneri/Syte2/issues) is always helpful.
